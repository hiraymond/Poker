A game description with basic game rules:
We proposed to make a one-player poker game, which the player would play with one computer player.
The game start with the player but-in amount(the total money he/she would have to enjoy the poker game)
Then, for each round, both player and computer would recevie two ramdom generated cards,
And player can add bet or withdraw from that round according to general poker rules.
Our program would determine who is winner after the final bet has been added in each round.
Player can choose to end game when he/she withdraw or finish each round.

Code Requirement:

1. Generation of random game sets or events
2. Data structures for storing game status
3. Dynamic memory management
4. File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)
5. Program codes in multiple files

Your implementation should encompass the following coding elements:

1. There would be total of nine different ramdom cards generated in each round. 
   (two for player hand cards, two for computer player hand cards, and five for the public deck)
2. We would be using int arrays to store cards for player, computer player, and public deck.
3.
4. use .txt file to save current hand of player, computer player and deck.
5. We will have a file for the computer player, a file for loading/saving game status, a file for user input and a file for the main        body.
